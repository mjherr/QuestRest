# QuestRest

    # My ultimate goal with this app is to create a balance of efficiency, productivity, self care and fun.

    Quest Rest will help users who struggle to balance the never ending list of routine chores with much needed self care, in the mental, physical or spiritual realms; whatever you enjoy doing!  Life will always have another chore for you to do, make time for yourself to have a little fun!

    Quest Rest won't be pushy or judgy- don't have the time, energy, or motivation to get that last chore in?  No problem, we can reschedule it!

    ### For our two week deadline I'd like accomplish the following:
    
    -"Welcome" screen that takes user input in order to suggest Quests or Rests
    -An 'energy' and 'experience' bar that gives a visual representation of completed task
    -A set of 'cards' for the user to choose from
        -those cards can be 'flipped over' (animation?) to give more details about the task
    -A log of tasks completed and over all stats
    -A database with default tasks
    -A form for users to create new tasks

    ### Stretch Goals:
    - Embedded Calender
    - Speed Run Mode (timed)
    - Daily/Weekly/Monthly Routines

***

    ### Agreeables: (things the group all agree on doing)
    - Card design for the tasks vice a list to give a less daunting feeling to the tasks left to do
